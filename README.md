# python-pcep
My notes and code for learning the Python PCEP. Slowly building this and it may become a Wikibook or published book, not sure. I don't really plan on this being a substitute for the official *Python Essentials 1* course material, but you never know.

## Syntax highlighting
*‚ÄúWelcome to my house! Enter freely. Go safely, and leave something of the happiness you bring.‚Äù* ‚Äï **Count Dracula, Bram Stoker**

I will use the Dracula theme for syntax highlighting the code snippets in the eventual PDF and EPUB along with the Twilio Sans Mono font.
