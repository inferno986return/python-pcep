# Python Essentials 1 - Module 2: Python Data Types, Variables, Operators and Basic I/O Operations

## Section 2.1: The "Hello World! program

`print()` is an important built-in function in Python as it allows an easy way to output data to the console. In Python 3, `print()` is built into the language itself and can take no arguments, where it only prints a blank line. 

When learning a programming language, it's common to start by outputting "Hello World" by using the built-in print function. So for Python 3:

```
print("Hello World")
```
```
Hello World
```

The use of single quotes `'` or double quotes `"` is used to define a string variable which holds `"Hello World"`.

By default, each `print()` statement automatically adds a newline `\n` character to separate outputs:

```
print("Hello")
print("World")
```

This outputs the following:

```
Hello
World
```

It is possible to print multiple outputs at once by using a comma `,` between them, in this case `"Hello"` and `"World"` are two separate strings: 

```
print("Hello", "World")
```
```
Hello World
```

The comma will add a space between the variables and keep them on one line as the newline `\n` is at the end of the `print()` statement, at least by default. Let's try outputting `"Hello"` and `"World"` over separate lines, but using only one `print()` function:

```
print("Hello\nWorld")
```

```
Hello
World
```

We can also use a tab `\t` to indent the output like so:

```
print("\tHello World")
```

```
    Hello World
```

The arguments `sep=` and `end=` can be optionally used at the end of a `print()` function to alter the output. Let's start with `sep=`.

`sep=` will replace the *default use of a space* between outputs with a character of your choice such as a hythen `-` or an asterisk `*`:

`print("Hello","World",sep="-")`

`Hello-World`

`end=` will replace the *default use of a newline* at the end of the line:

```
print("Hello",end="")
print("World")
```

`HelloWorld`

With this example the two strings have just concatenated together to form one simple output using camelcase.

## Section 2.2: Python literals

### Underscores in integers and floats

Python (apparently since Python 3.6) supports using underscores (_) as a substitute for commas for breaking up large integer and float variables such as 100,000 being represented as `100_000`. This is purely cosmetic to provide human readability and doesn't affect the value. With strings, the underscore is part of the string.

`print(100_000)`

`100000`

`print("100_000")`

`100_000`

### Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal

Binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers can be represented as **literals** using this notation. An easy way to remember hexadecimal is that many memory addresses start with `0x` or you can just use the simple mnemonic of *box*:

| Syntax:      | Numeric base:         | Example: |
| -------------| --------------------- | -------- |
| `0b` or `0B` | Binary (base-2)       | `0b1010` |
| `0o` or `0O` | Octal (base-8)        | `0o70`   |
| `0x` or `0X` | Hexademical (base-16) | `0x2AF`  |

**Note:** This numerical base notation is case-insensitive.

While not specifically mentioned in the Python Essentials 1 notes, it's worth knowing that *by default Python 3 outputs to standard Decimal (base-10) when performing calculations in different numerical bases.* However, there are the `bin()`, `oct()` and `hex()` functions which maintain the chosen notation:

`print(0b1 + 0b1)`

`2`

`print(bin(0b1 + 0b1))`

`0b10`

Binary values can be easily calculated by just counting the ones in each column like so, for example, the number `48` in decimal (base-10) is represented as:

| 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| -- | -- | -- | - | - | - | - |
| `0`| `1`| `1`|`0`|`0`|`0`|`0`| 

## Section 3: Operators â€“ data manipulation tools

### Order of operations

Python uses an order of operations similar to PEMDAS, the US counterpart to BODMAS:

1. **P**arentheses or brackets â€“ `()`
2. **E**xponentiation or of â€“ `**` or x^y or x<sup>y</sup>
3. **M**ultiplication â€“ `*` or Ã—
4. **D**ivision â€“ `/` or Ã·
5. **A**ddition â€“ `+`
6. **S**ubtraction â€“ `-`

### Exponentiation

Exponentiation is the formal mathematical term for multiplying a value by itself several times. In British English, we usually say "x to the power of y".

* **Exponentiation** (`**`) is two asterisks put together. For example, `2 ** 2` will output `4`.

Exponentiation is notably the *only operator which is right-side bound by default* though this can be overridden by using brackets.

`print(2 ** 2 ** 3)`

`256`

Which is equivalent to:

`print(2 ** (2 ** 3))`

`256`

However, we can force left-side binding by using brackets:

`print((2 ** 2) ** 3)`

`64`

Lastly, we have literal exponentiation using the letter `E` for expressing very large (or small numbers) such as 2Ã—10<sup>8</sup> (200,000,000), which would be `2E8` with this notation.

`print(2E8)`

`20000000.0`

Using an exponential with `E` creates a float value. Though as usual this can be forced into an integer by using `int()`.

### Left-side and right-side binding

The operators in Python are by default left-side bound except exponentiation. This means that calculations are performed from left-to-right:

`2 - 1 + 3`
`4`

### Three ways to divide â€“ Division `/`, floor division `//` and modulo `%`

Python has three built-in forms of division:

1. **Division** (`/`) is the standard division operator which will *always* output a float value. For example, `9 / 3` will output `3.0`
2. **Floor division** (`//`) creates an integer by rounding the output to the lowest number and then removing all the values beyond the decimal point. For example, running floor division on these outputs `3` each time: `3.1`, `3.5`, `3.9`
3. **Modulo** (`%`) gives the remainder of a division as an integer. It can be useful for checking divisibility i.e. whether 9 is divisible by 3 or determining if a value is even.

Modulo can be manually calculated with these steps. For example, let's try `2 % 5`:

1. **Divide** the dividend (first number, two `2`) and divisor (second number, five `5`) normally `2 // 5`. All decimal quotients less (results) are rounded to the nearest integer â€“ zero `0` in this case.
2. **Multiply** the quotient (zero `0`) by the divisor (five `5`), `0 * 5 ` (which is zero `0`)
3. **Subtract** the result from the original dividend, `2 - 0` (which is two `2`)
4. The **remainder** is two `2` in this example.

Refer to and test this sample function:

```
def modulo(x, y):
    z = x // y # Divide as usual, but force an integer
    m = z * y # Multiply the quotient by the divisor
    r = x - m # Subtract the dividend1 to find remainder
    return r

x = int(input("x: "))
y = int(input("y: "))
print("Remainder:", modulo(x, y))
print("Should be:", x % y)
```

In summary, division `/` always outputs a **float** and both floor division `//` and modulo `%` always output an **integer**.

If it's easier, you could refer to them as *float division* and *integer division* respectively. Ceiling division is the opposite of floor division, but there's no built-in operator for it and instead there is a function avilable in the built-in `math` library, but this is outside the scope of the PCEP.

It may also be outside the scope of the PCEP, but you may as well know the terminology: dividend / divisor = quotient

* The **dividend** is the number that is being divided. It represents the total amount that you are splitting into equal parts.
* The **divisor** is the number by which you are dividing the dividend. It represents the number of equal parts you are creating.
* The **quotient** is the result of the division. It represents the size of each equal part you obtain after dividing the dividend by the divisor.

See also: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/division.html

And finally, division by zero is mathematically undefined. Therefore it will throw a `ZeroDivisionError` error if you try to use zero (`0`) as the divisor which will stop the program execution by default:

`3 / 0`

`Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`

This also applies to floor division `//` where the divisor is a decimal number such as `0.25` or `0.5`.

In a later module, we discuss how to manage exceptions including dividing by zero errors to keep the program running. ðŸ˜€

### Variables

Like many interpreted programming languages, Python uses **dynamic variables** which means a variable's datatype is defined by the value itself rather than specific datatype keyword designation. 

Python variable names are *case-sensitive* which means that `y = 1` and `Y = 2` can technically co-exist in the same block of code together while meaning different things. However, this can still cause unnecessary confusion to a human programmer:

`y = 0`

`Y = 1`

`print(y, Y)`

### Variable datatypes

For the PCEP, these datatypes are the only ones covered though there are many more built into Python 3:

* Integer â€“ whole numbers such as `1`, `10` and `100`
* Float â€“ decimal numbers such as `1.0`, `.5` and `1.23`
* String â€“ a character or series of characters using single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes such as `"Hello"`, `"10"` and `"This is a sentence."`
* Boolean â€“ either `True` or `False` (booleans are case-sensitive)

These are covered in much more detail in later modules:

* List â€“ a collection of values of any datatype in any order and with duplicates (very flexible): `[0,1,2,3,4,5,"potato",True]`
* Tuple â€“ an immutable ordered collection of variables with no duplicate values such as: `(1,2,3,4,5, "apple")`
* Dictionary â€“ a collection of key:value pairs, similar to a list. Since Python 3.6, they are ordered by default and no longer randomised: `["sandwich:chicken","drink:orange_juice","soup:tomato"]`
* `None` â€“ an empty value equivalent to NULL in other programming languages. Technically a datatype of its own which is returned by all functions that have no `return` statement.
