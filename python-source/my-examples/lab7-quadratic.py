# lab7-quadratic.py - Evalulate this expression ⁅𝑦=3𝑥^3−2𝑥^2+3𝑥−1⁆, you can also put it into a graphing calculator. :-)

# Sample input

# x = 0
# x = 1
# x = -1

# Sample output

# y = -1.0
# y = 3.0
# y = -9.0

x = -1 # Hardcode your test data here.
print(f"x = {x}")
x = float(x)

y = 3*x**3 - 2*x**2 + 3*x - 1 # Write your code here.
print(f"y = {y}")
