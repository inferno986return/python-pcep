### LAB: Collatz conjecture

Collatz conjecture is an unsolved yet simplistic mathematical problem and the second lab exercise for while loops. For the sake of this Python lab, every c0 which is a positive integer (that isn't zero) with enough steps can be made equal to 1.

1. Take a positive integer which is greater than or equal to 1 and label it as c0.
2. For even numbers, divide c0 by 2;
3. For odd numbers, multiply c0 by 3 and add 1.
4. With enough repetition, do all positive integers converge to 1?

The PCEP example for `c0 = 15` might be incorrect. Here's my output:

`Enter a number for c0:15`

`46`

`23`

`70`

`35`

`106`

`53`

`160`

`80`

`40`

`20`

`10`

`5`

`16`

`8`

`4`

`2`

`1`

`steps = 17`
