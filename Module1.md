# Python Essentials 1 – Module 1: Computer Programming and Python Fundamentals 

Alphabet in the context of computer science are the symbols used for the programming language, with most programming languages including Python using English words with the Latin alphabet.

Note that some programming languages such as APL use symbols instead, which in this instance are APL symbols resembling the Greek letters Omega, Rho and Iota along with other symbols. I took this `for` loop example from Rosetta Code:

`stars ← { ⍵ 1 ⍴ {⍵/'*'}¨⍳⍵ }`


Lexis is the complete set of words for a language. In natrual languages these are defined in a dictonary.

Wikipedia has a fantastic definition of the word lexis along with its Ancient Greek etymology.
> In linguistics, the term lexis (from Ancient Greek: λέξις 'word') designates the complete set of all possible words in a language, or a particular subset of words that are grouped by some specific linguistic criteria. For example, the general term English lexis refers to all words of the English language,

Syntax
>In computer science, the syntax of a computer language is the rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language. This applies both to programming languages, where the document represents source code, and to markup languages, where the document represents data.
